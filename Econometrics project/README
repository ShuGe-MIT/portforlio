Overall structure of the current code: 
Refer to Model.pdf for the models used in this code.
Refer to SUR_robust_cluster_for_vce for calculation of variance covariance matrices using linear Seemingly unrelated regressions(SUR).

cal_lambda.m takes alpha and prices as input and produce the lambdas as defined in the model solution.

calculate_std.m calculates the standard deviation of a probability distribution. The input sup is the support of the distribution, the input prob is the probability of each point, n is the number of discretized grids.

compute_wald.m computes the Wald metric given a guess of structural parameters. The input para is the guess, the input data is the data (including the prices, shocks, etc.), the input BETA_data, W_data are computed from the data (these are, respectively, structural coefficients and covariance matrix computed from the true data adding the error term (equivalent to the data we collect)).

construct_S.m constructs the matrix from which we generate the error terms. The values are from Table 1 of the draft paper.

ini_normal.m discretize and initialize a normal distribution given the mean and standard deviation. The lower and upper bounds are respectively mean±3*std.

parameter.m contains all the parameter values.

price.m creates the distribution of the prices of all the input factors. The mean values are from Table 3 of the draft paper. The std values are chosen such that the generated discretized distribution has the same standard deviation as the values in Table 3.

random_num.m creates an x*y matrix of random numbers with lower and upper bounds specified.

shock.m creates the distribution of all the shocks, with mean and standard deviation from Table 3.

solve_x.m solves the model with given structural parameter values. solve_x1.m, solve_x2.m, solve_x3.m solve the input and output of each stage. solve_x.m calls solve_x1.m, solve_x2.m, and solve_x3.m in turn. 

SUR.m does the seemingly unrelated regression without clustering or heterogeneity. The formula could be found at SUR_robust_cluster_for_vce.pdf, section 2.

SUR_real.m does the SUR with clustering. The formula follows SUR_robust_cluster_for_vce.pdf, section 3.1. 

SUR_synthetic.m does SUR with robust covariance, but without clustering, following the same pdf, section 3.2.

Note: SUR non-matrix .m files use optimal (in terms of fastest run time) combination of matrix and summation notation

form_ini_guess_full.m formulates the initial guess. For gamma and theta, we use grid search. The function also parse out the initial guesses that yield imaginary number input output values.

polish_initial_guess.m polishes the initial guess from form_ini_guess_full.m. The function improves the initial guess through trying different gamma and theta value.

summary.m generates the summary tables.

main_file.m acts as the main function. The logic flow goes as the following:
1. get structural parameter values from parameter.m.
2. draw initial distribution of prices, shocks, and initial conditions.
3. solve the model with the initial distribution and the paramter values.
4. generate the error term sai.
5. generate initial guesses for alpha and initial condition
6. use fmincon to match

eps_data.mat contains realized shocks.
guess_polished.mat contains the polished initial guesses.
price_data.mat contains realized prices.
result_with_regression_little_sai.mat contains the structural model solution with the true parameter value.
structural parameter.mat contains the true structural parameter values.
y0.mat contains realized initial conditions.

MATLAB operations that we have tried so far: fmincon, patternsearch, SNOPT
